    "**Concept of R-squared in Linear Regression Models:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Definition:** R-squared (or \\( R^2 \\)) is a statistical measure that represents the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable (\\(Y\\)) that is predictable from the independent variable(s) (\\(X\\)) in a linear regression model. It provides an indication of how well the regression model explains the variability in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Calculation:**\n",
    "  - **Formula:**\n",
    "    \\[\n",
    "    R^2 = 1 - \\frac{\\text{Sum of Squared Residuals (SSR)}}{\\text{Total Sum of Squares (SST)}\n",
    "    \\]\n",
    "    Where:\n",
    "    - **Sum of Squared Residuals (SSR)** is the sum of the squared differences between the observed values and the predicted values from the model.\n",
    "    - **Total Sum of Squares (SST)** is the sum of the squared differences between the observed values and the mean of the observed values.\n",
    "  \n",
    "    Alternatively, it can be computed as:\n",
    "    \\[\n",
    "    R^2 = \\frac{\\text{Explained Variance}}{\\text{Total Variance}}\n",
    "    \\]\n",
    "    Where:\n",
    "    - **Explained Variance** is the variance explained by the model (i.e., variance of the predicted values),\n",
    "    - **Total Variance** is the variance of the observed values.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Representation:**\n",
    "  - **Value Range:** \\( R^2 \\) ranges from 0 to 1. \n",
    "    - **0:** Indicates that the model explains none of the variance in the dependent variable.\n",
    "    - **1:** Indicates that the model explains all the variance in the dependent variable.\n",
    "  - **Interpretation:**\n",
    "    - **Higher R-squared:** A higher \\( R^2 \\) value indicates a better fit of the model to the data, meaning a larger proportion of the variance is explained by the model.\n",
    "    - **Lower R-squared:** A lower \\( R^2 \\) value suggests that the model does not explain much of the variance, and there may be other factors influencing the dependent variable not captured by the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you have a linear regression model predicting house prices based on square footage. After fitting the model, you calculate an \\( R^2 \\) value of 0.85.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Interpretation:** This \\( R^2 \\) value of 0.85 means that 85% of the variance in house prices can be explained by the model based on square footage. The remaining 15% of the variance is attributed to other factors or noise not captured by the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Points to Note:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Not a Measure of Causation:** \\( R^2 \\) indicates how well the model fits the data but does not imply causation or that the model is the best one. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Adjusted R-squared:** In multiple regression models, \\( R^2 \\) can be artificially inflated by adding more predictors. Adjusted R-squared adjusts for the number of predictors and provides a more accurate measure of model fit, especially when comparing models with different numbers of predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Limitations:** A high \\( R^2 \\) does not necessarily mean that the model is good. It does not account for model assumptions or the possibility of overfitting. It should be considered alongside other metrics and validation methods."

    "\n",
    "**How it Differs from Regular R-squared:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Adjustment for Number of Predictors:**\n",
    "   - **Regular R-squared:** Measures the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that is explained by the independent variables. It increases with the addition of more predictors, regardless of whether those predictors are meaningful or not.\n",
    "   - **Adjusted R-squared:** Adjusts for the number of predictors in the model. It penalizes the model for adding predictors that do not improve the model's fit significantly. This helps to prevent overfitting by accounting for the complexity of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Value Interpretation:**\n",
    "   - **Regular R-squared:** Can be artificially high if unnecessary predictors are included. The value ranges from 0 to 1, where a higher value indicates a better fit.\n",
    "   - **Adjusted R-squared:** Can decrease if additional predictors do not improve the model’s fit. It can be lower than \\( R^2 \\) if the new predictors are not contributing to explaining the variance in the dependent variable. The value can be less than 0 if the model fits worse than a horizontal line representing the mean of the dependent variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Model Comparison:**\n",
    "   - **Regular R-squared:** Does not account for the number of predictors, so comparing models with different numbers of predictors using \\( R^2 \\) alone can be misleading.\n",
    "   - **Adjusted R-squared:** Provides a more reliable measure for comparing models with different numbers of predictors. A higher adjusted \\( R^2 \\) indicates a better model fit after accounting for the number of predictors.\n",

    "**Appropriate Use of Adjusted R-squared:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **When Comparing Models with Different Numbers of Predictors:**\n",
    "   - **Scenario:** When you have multiple regression models with varying numbers of predictors, adjusted R-squared is more appropriate than regular R-squared. It adjusts for the number of predictors, helping you compare models and determine if additional predictors provide a genuine improvement in model fit or if they are simply adding complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **When Evaluating Model Performance:**\n",
    "   - **Scenario:** If you’re assessing how well a model explains the variability in the dependent variable while accounting for the number of predictors, adjusted R-squared gives a more accurate reflection of model performance. It provides insight into whether the model is overfitting by penalizing excessive predictors that do not significantly contribute to explaining the variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **When Avoiding Overfitting:**\n",
    "   - **Scenario:** When building models, especially with a large number of predictors, adjusted R-squared helps mitigate the risk of overfitting. It penalizes the inclusion of irrelevant predictors, helping ensure that the model does not become overly complex and that its predictive power remains robust.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **When Reporting Results for Model Selection:**\n",
    "   - **Scenario:** In reports or presentations where model selection is critical, using adjusted R-squared helps communicate the efficiency and effectiveness of the model in explaining the variance, considering the number of predictors used. It aids in justifying the choice of the model based on both fit and simplicity.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **When Evaluating the Impact of Adding New Predictors:**\n",
    "   - **Scenario:** If you are testing the impact of adding new predictors to a model, adjusted R-squared is useful for determining if the new predictors genuinely improve the model. A significant increase in adjusted R-squared indicates that the additional predictors are valuable, while a negligible or negative change suggests they might not be contributing meaningfully.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Scenario:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you are developing a model to predict customer satisfaction based on various factors such as age, income, and number of purchases. You start with a simple model using age and income and then add more predictors like number of purchases and customer feedback scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Initial Model:** Has an \\( R^2 \\) of 0.60.\n",
    "- **Extended Model:** After adding more predictors, the \\( R^2 \\) increases to 0.75.\n",

    "- **Adjusted \\( R^2 \\) for Initial Model:** 0.58\n",
    "- **Adjusted \\( R^2 \\) for Extended Model:** 0.72\n",
    "\n",
    "The increase in adjusted R-squared (from 0.58 to 0.72) indicates that the additional predictors provide a meaningful improvement in model fit, while the initial \\( R^2 \\) increase could have been misleading due to the higher number of predictors."

    "### **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages:**\n",
    "1. **Sensitive to Larger Errors:**\n",
    "   - **Advantage:** MSE penalizes larger errors more heavily due to the squaring of the residuals. This can be useful when large errors are particularly undesirable and you want to ensure the model performs well across the entire range of data.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Mathematically Convenient:**\n",
    "   - **Advantage:** MSE is differentiable, making it mathematically convenient for optimization algorithms, particularly in gradient-based methods used in machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Emphasizes Variance:**\n",
    "   - **Advantage:** It provides a measure of the variance of the residuals, which can be useful for understanding the spread of errors around the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Disadvantages:**\n",
    "1. **Sensitive to Outliers:**\n",
    "   - **Disadvantage:** Because MSE squares the errors, it is highly sensitive to outliers. A few large errors can disproportionately affect the overall metric, leading to potentially misleading evaluations of model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Not in Same Units as Data:**\n",
    "   - **Disadvantage:** MSE is in squared units of the dependent variable, which can make it less intuitive to interpret compared to metrics in the original units.\n",

    "### **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages:**\n",
    "1. **Intuitive Interpretation:**\n",
    "   - **Advantage:** RMSE is in the same units as the dependent variable, making it easier to interpret. It represents the average magnitude of the errors in the same scale as the original data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Sensitive to Larger Errors:**\n",

    "\n",
    "2. **Less Robust:**\n",
    "   - **Disadvantage:** Due to its sensitivity to larger errors, RMSE might not be as robust in datasets with significant noise or outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages:**\n",
    "1. **Robust to Outliers:**\n",

    "3. **Easy to Compute:**\n",
    "   - **Advantage:** MAE is simple to compute and does not involve squaring or square-root operations, making it computationally less intensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Disadvantages:**\n",
    "1. **Less Sensitive to Larger Errors:**\n",

    "**Concept:**\n",
    "- **Definition:** Lasso regularization (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) is a technique used in regression analysis to prevent overfitting by penalizing the absolute magnitude of the coefficients of the predictors. It encourages sparsity in the model, meaning it tends to produce models with fewer non-zero coefficients.\n",
    "- **Objective Function:**\n",
    "  \\[\n",
    "  \\text{Lasso Objective} = \\text{Least Squares Loss} + \\lambda \\sum_{j=1}^{p} |\\beta_j|\n",

    "  - \\(\\lambda\\) is the regularization parameter (penalty term),\n",
    "  - \\(\\beta_j\\) are the coefficients of the predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How It Differs from Ridge Regularization:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Penalty Term:**\n",
    "   - **Lasso Regularization:** Uses the L1 norm of the coefficients, which is the sum of the absolute values of the coefficients. This can drive some coefficients exactly to zero, effectively performing feature selection.\n",
    "   - **Ridge Regularization:** Uses the L2 norm of the coefficients, which is the sum of the squared values of the coefficients. Ridge regularization tends to shrink the coefficients towards zero but does not set them exactly to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Effect on Coefficients:**\n",
    "   - **Lasso Regularization:** Can result in a sparse model by setting some coefficients to exactly zero. This can be particularly useful when dealing with high-dimensional data where some features might be irrelevant.\n",
    "   - **Ridge Regularization:** Reduces the magnitude of the coefficients but keeps all features in the model. It is more suitable when dealing with multicollinearity or when all predictors are believed to be relevant.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Feature Selection:**\n",
    "   - **Lasso Regularization:** Performs feature selection by zeroing out some coefficients. This can lead to a simpler and more interpretable model.\n",
    "   - **Ridge Regularization:** Does not perform feature selection. All predictors remain in the model, which can be useful when you believe all features are potentially important.\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to Use Lasso Regularization:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **High-Dimensional Data:**\n",
    "   - **Appropriate:** When dealing with datasets with a large number of features, Lasso can help in identifying and selecting the most relevant predictors by driving less important feature coefficients to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Feature Selection Needed:**\n",
    "   - **Appropriate:** When you need to simplify the model and focus on a subset of important features, Lasso can reduce the number of variables in the model, enhancing interpretability.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Sparse Models:**\n",
    "   - **Appropriate:** When you prefer models that are easier to interpret and where only a few predictors are expected to contribute significantly to the response variable.\n",

    "\n",
    "Suppose you have a dataset with 100 predictors, but you believe only a few are truly relevant for predicting the outcome. By applying Lasso regularization, some coefficients might be shrunk to zero, resulting in a model with only a few non-zero predictors. This sparse model is not only simpler and potentially more interpretable but also can reduce overfitting by excluding less relevant predictors."

    "**How Regularized Linear Models Prevent Overfitting:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Concept of Overfitting:**\n",
    "- **Definition:** Overfitting occurs when a machine learning model learns not only the underlying pattern in the training data but also the noise or random fluctuations. This results in a model that performs well on the training data but poorly on unseen or test data because it fails to generalize well.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Regularized Linear Models:**\n",
    "- **Purpose:** Regularization techniques are used to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty to the model’s complexity. This encourages the model to avoid fitting the noise in the training data and to focus on capturing the underlying patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Types of Regularization:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **L1 Regularization (Lasso):**\n",
    "   - **Penalty Term:** Adds the sum of the absolute values of the coefficients to the loss function.\n",
    "   - **Effect:** Can drive some coefficients exactly to zero, effectively performing feature selection and simplifying the model. This reduces complexity and helps prevent overfitting by excluding less relevant features.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **L2 Regularization (Ridge):**\n",
    "   - **Penalty Term:** Adds the sum of the squared values of the coefficients to the loss function.\n",
    "   - **Effect:** Shrinks the coefficients towards zero but does not set them exactly to zero. This helps to control the model complexity and mitigate issues with multicollinearity, improving generalization and reducing overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Elastic Net:**\n",
    "   - **Combination:** Combines L1 and L2 regularization penalties.\n",
    "   - **Effect:** Balances the feature selection of Lasso and the coefficient shrinkage of Ridge, providing a flexible approach to managing model complexity and preventing overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example to Illustrate:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scenario:**\n",
    "- Suppose you are building a linear regression model to predict house prices based on a dataset with many features, including some that are irrelevant or noisy.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Without Regularization:**\n",
    "- **Model:** A linear regression model trained on this dataset might end up fitting the training data very well, capturing even the noise and irrelevant features.\n",
    "- **Issue:** When evaluated on a separate test dataset, the model may perform poorly due to its inability to generalize, as it has overfitted the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**With Regularization:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **L1 Regularization (Lasso):**\n",
    "   - **Application:** Apply Lasso regularization to the linear regression model.\n",
    "   - **Effect:** The model will perform feature selection, driving the coefficients of less relevant features to zero. This results in a simpler model with fewer features, reducing the risk of overfitting and improving performance on the test dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **L2 Regularization (Ridge):**\n",
    "   - **Application:** Apply Ridge regularization to the linear regression model.\n",
    "   - **Effect:** The model will have smaller, more controlled coefficients, reducing the impact of noisy features. This helps prevent overfitting by ensuring that no single feature dominates the model and improves generalization to new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Elastic Net:**\n",
    "   - **Application:** Apply Elastic Net regularization, combining both L1 and L2 penalties.\n",
    "   - **Effect:** The model benefits from both feature selection and coefficient shrinkage. It retains the most relevant features while controlling the size of the coefficients, offering a balanced approach to managing complexity and reducing overfitting."

   "source": [
    "**Limitations of Regularized Linear Models:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Assumption of Linearity:**\n",
    "   - **Limitation:** Regularized linear models, including Lasso and Ridge, assume that the relationship between predictors and the response variable is linear. This assumption may not hold true in many real-world scenarios where the relationships are complex or nonlinear.\n",
    "   - **Impact:** If the true relationship is nonlinear, regularized linear models may not capture the underlying patterns adequately, leading to suboptimal performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Feature Engineering and Scaling:**\n",
    "   - **Limitation:** Regularized models often require proper feature scaling and careful feature engineering. Features need to be scaled to ensure that the regularization term is applied consistently across all features.\n",
    "   - **Impact:** Without proper scaling, regularization may disproportionately penalize features with larger scales, leading to biased coefficient estimates. Additionally, feature engineering to address nonlinear relationships or interactions may still be necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Inability to Handle Complex Interactions:**\n",
    "   - **Limitation:** While regularized linear models can manage high-dimensional data and prevent overfitting, they may not effectively handle complex interactions between predictors or capture intricate patterns in the data.\n",
    "   - **Impact:** For datasets where interactions between variables play a significant role, regularized linear models might fail to capture these interactions, potentially missing important aspects of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Model Interpretability vs. Complexity:**\n",
    "   - **Limitation:** Regularization aims to simplify models by penalizing the complexity of coefficients. However, this can sometimes lead to overly simplified models that might not capture the full complexity of the data.\n",
    "   - **Impact:** In some cases, the reduction in model complexity may come at the expense of losing important predictive power, which could affect the overall accuracy of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Over-penalization:**\n",
    "   - **Limitation:** The choice of the regularization parameter \\(\\lambda\\) is crucial. If the penalty is set too high, the model may become too simple, underfitting the data and failing to capture essential patterns.\n",
    "   - **Impact:** Over-penalization can result in poor predictive performance as the model becomes too generalized and unable to fit the training data well.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **No Handling of Categorical Variables Directly:**\n",
    "   - **Limitation:** Regularized linear models require categorical variables to be converted into numerical format through techniques like one-hot encoding. This preprocessing step may not always be straightforward, and improper encoding can lead to issues with model performance.\n",
    "   - **Impact:** If categorical variables are not handled correctly, the model might not leverage all relevant information, affecting its ability to make accurate predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Computational Complexity for Large Datasets:**\n",
    "   - **Limitation:** For very large datasets with a high number of features, the computational cost of applying regularization techniques can become significant. This can make model training time-consuming and resource-intensive.\n",
    "   - **Impact:** High computational costs may limit the feasibility of using regularized linear models for very large-scale problems or datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "**When Regularized Linear Models May Not Be the Best Choice:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Nonlinear Relationships:**\n",
    "   - **Alternative:** For datasets with complex nonlinear relationships, models such as decision trees, support vector machines with nonlinear kernels, or neural networks may be more appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Complex Feature Interactions:**\n",
    "   - **Alternative:** If there are complex interactions between features, methods like polynomial regression, interaction terms, or advanced ensemble methods might be more effective in capturing these interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **High-Dimensional Data with Sparse Features:**\n",
    "   - **Alternative:** For extremely high-dimensional data where feature sparsity is a concern, methods like Lasso regularization are useful, but sometimes more advanced techniques like feature embedding or dimensionality reduction methods (e.g., PCA) are needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Predictive Power vs. Interpretability:**\n",
    "   - **Alternative:** If interpretability is crucial and you need a balance between simplicity and performance, methods like generalized additive models (GAMs) might provide more interpretability while still capturing nonlinear relationships."

    "\n",
    "Given:\n",
    "- **Model A:** RMSE = 10\n",
    "- **Model B:** MAE = 8\n",
    "\n",
    "**Choosing the Better Model:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Understanding RMSE and MAE:**\n",
    "   - **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):** Measures the square root of the average squared differences between the predicted and actual values. It is sensitive to large errors because it squares the residuals, which means it penalizes larger errors more heavily.\n",
    "   - **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** Measures the average magnitude of the errors in the predictions, treating all errors equally. It is less sensitive to outliers compared to RMSE.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Factors to Consider:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Sensitivity to Outliers:**\n",
    "   - **Model A (RMSE = 10):** RMSE is more sensitive to outliers due to the squaring of residuals. If your dataset contains significant outliers, Model A might have been disproportionately affected by them.\n",
    "   - **Model B (MAE = 8):** MAE is more robust to outliers and provides a straightforward measure of average error. If you prefer a model that performs well across all data points without being overly influenced by outliers, Model B might be preferable.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Error Magnitude and Interpretation:**\n",
    "   - **Model A:** An RMSE of 10 suggests that, on average, the model's prediction errors are larger due to the squaring effect. This might be a concern if larger errors are particularly problematic for your application.\n",
    "   - **Model B:** An MAE of 8 indicates that the model’s average prediction error is slightly lower, and all errors are treated with equal importance. If consistent accuracy across predictions is more important, Model B might be better.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Specific Context and Requirements:**\n",
    "   - **Model Choice:** The decision between RMSE and MAE should be based on the context and what aspect of error you prioritize:\n",
    "     - If you are concerned about large errors and their impact, RMSE might give you a better sense of the model’s performance in scenarios with larger deviations.\n",
    "     - If you are more concerned with overall consistency and robustness to outliers, MAE provides a more stable measure of average error.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Limitations of the Chosen Metric:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Metric Sensitivity:**\n",
    "   - **RMSE Limitation:** RMSE's sensitivity to large errors means that it may not accurately reflect the model’s performance if outliers are present. It can skew the perception of performance if the dataset has a few large errors.\n",
    "   - **MAE Limitation:** MAE does not penalize larger errors as heavily as RMSE, which might not be ideal if larger errors are particularly critical in your application. MAE also does not provide information about the variance of the errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **No Single Metric Is Perfect:**\n",
    "   - **Limitations:** No single evaluation metric can capture all aspects of model performance. RMSE and MAE each have their strengths and weaknesses. It is often useful to consider multiple metrics to get a comprehensive understanding of model performance.\n",
    "   - **Additional Metrics:** In addition to RMSE and MAE, other metrics such as R-squared, Adjusted R-squared, and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) can provide further insights into model performance."

    "  - **Penalty Term:** Adds the L1 norm of the coefficients (sum of absolute values of coefficients) to the loss function.\n",
    "  - **Effect:** Can drive some coefficients exactly to zero, performing automatic feature selection. This results in a sparser model with fewer non-zero coefficients, which can be beneficial for feature reduction and interpretability.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Factors to Consider:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Feature Selection:**\n",
    "   - **Model B (Lasso):** If feature selection is important, Model B with Lasso regularization might be preferable. Lasso's ability to set some coefficients to zero can simplify the model by excluding less important features, making it more interpretable and potentially improving generalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Handling Multicollinearity:**\n",
    "   - **Model A (Ridge):** If multicollinearity is a concern and you want to include all predictors without setting any coefficients to zero, Model A with Ridge regularization may be more appropriate. Ridge regularization reduces the impact of correlated features but retains all predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Regularization Parameter (\\(\\lambda\\)):**\n",
    "   - **Model A:** \\(\\lambda = 0.1\\) indicates a relatively low level of regularization. This might mean that the Ridge regularization effect is weaker, and the model might be closer to a standard linear regression with minor shrinkage of coefficients.\n",
    "   - **Model B:** \\(\\lambda = 0.5\\) indicates a higher level of regularization, which may result in more coefficients being driven to zero, potentially simplifying the model but also increasing the risk of underfitting if set too high.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "**Trade-offs and Limitations:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Ridge Regularization (Model A):**\n",
    "   - **Trade-off:** While Ridge regularization handles multicollinearity and retains all features, it does not perform feature selection. This might result in a more complex model that includes all predictors, which can be a disadvantage if you seek a simpler, more interpretable model.\n",
    "   - **Limitation:** Ridge does not help with model sparsity and does not inherently reduce the number of features, which might be less desirable in high-dimensional datasets where feature selection is crucial.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Lasso Regularization (Model B):**\n",
    "   - **Trade-off:** Lasso’s ability to set coefficients to zero can lead to a simpler and more interpretable model. However, setting \\(\\lambda\\) too high might result in too many coefficients being zeroed out, potentially leading to underfitting.\n",
    "   - **Limitation:** Lasso may not handle multicollinearity as effectively as Ridge, especially if multiple features are highly correlated. In such cases, the model might become unstable or overly simplified."
