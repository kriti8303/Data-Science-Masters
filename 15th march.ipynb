    "1. Artificial Intelligence : AI has a come a long way since the last 70-odd years, infiltrating into every aspect of our life, whether we know it, and like it or not. Advancements in machine learning and deep learning over the last decade have created an AI boom across industries and organisations of all sizes. Cloud service providers have added to the momentum by developing open source services that are available for free and by offering new use cases.\n",
    "2. Machine learning : ML is the use of algorithms to process, learn and make sense or predict the pattern of available data. More recently, the low-code and no-code concepts of software development are being used in machine learning as self-learning processes that give specific instructions to accomplish particular tasks. The machine is ‘trained’ by using data and algorithms, giving it the ability to learn how to perform the task and, more importantly, apply the learning to evolve continuously.\n",
    "3. Deep learning : DL is an evolution of neural networks and machine learning, and the brainchild of the AI community. It learns about how the human mind works in specific scenarios, and then gets better at that job than humans! As an example, IBM’s Watson played chess against itself and improved at the game so much to eventually beat the world champion. Google’s AlphaGo also learnt how to play the Go board game by playing it over and over to better itself, and became the champion."

    "Supervised learning, also known as supervised machine learning, is a subcategory of machine learning and artificial intelligence. It is defined by its use of labeled datasets to train algorithms that to classify data or predict outcomes accurately. As input data is fed into the model, it adjusts its weights until the model has been fitted appropriately, which occurs as part of the cross validation process. Supervised learning helps organizations solve for a variety of real-world problems at scale, such as classifying spam in a separate folder from your inbox.\n",

    "Example : Spam detection: Spam detection is another example of a supervised learning model. Using supervised classification algorithms, organizations can train databases to recognize patterns or anomalies in new data to organize spam and non-spam-related correspondences effectively."

    "Unsupervised learning is when it can provide a set of unlabelled data, which it is required to analyze and find patterns inside. The examples are dimension reduction and clustering. The training is supported to the machine with the group of data that has not been labeled, classified, or categorized, and the algorithm required to facilitate on that data without some supervision. The objective of unsupervised learning is to restructure the input record into new features or a set of objects with same patterns.\n",

    "1. Training data is the set of the data on which the actual training takes place. Validation split helps to improve the model performance by fine-tuning the model after each epoch. The test set informs us about the final accuracy of the model after completing the training phase.\n",
    "2. The training set should not be too small; else, the model will not have enough data to learn. On the other hand, if the validation set is too small, then the evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score will have large variance and will not lead to the proper tuning of the model.\n",
