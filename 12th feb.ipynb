    "An exception in Python is an event that disrupts the normal flow of the program's execution. It is a signal that something unexpected or erroneous has occurred. When an exceptional event occurs, Python creates an exception object, which can be handled to prevent the program from crashing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Difference between exceptions and syntax errors:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Syntax errors: These are errors that occur when the Python parser encounters incorrect syntax in the code. It typically occurs during the parsing of the code before the program is executed. Examples of syntax errors include missing parentheses, invalid indentation, or incorrect keywords. These errors prevent the code from being compiled and executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Exceptions: These are errors that occur during the execution of a program. They represent any error that occurs during the execution of the code and disrupts the normal flow of the program. Examples of exceptions include division by zero, trying to access a key that does not exist in a dictionary, or attempting to open a file that does not exist. Exceptions can be handled using try-except blocks, allowing the program to handle the error and continue executing."
