    "A database is an organized collection of structured information or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system. Databases are managed by Database Management Systems (DBMS), which allow for efficient retrieval, insertion, update, and deletion of data. Databases can store vast amounts of data and provide various mechanisms for data integrity, security, and concurrency control.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Differences Between SQL and NoSQL Databases:\n",
    "#### 1. Structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "* SQL Databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use tables with rows and columns to organize data.\n",
    "2. Require a fixed schema, meaning the structure of data must be defined in advance.\n",
    "Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle.\n",
    "\n",
    "* NoSQL Databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use various models like key-value, document, column-family, or graph to store data.\n",
    "2. Have flexible schemas, allowing for easy changes to data structure.\n",
    "Examples: MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Scalability:\n",
    "\n",
    "* SQL Databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Typically scale by upgrading the hardware of a single server (vertical scaling).\n",
    "2. Can be more complex to scale out to multiple servers (horizontal scaling).\n",
    "\n",
    "* NoSQL Databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Designed to scale out across many servers easily (horizontal scaling).\n",
    "2. Handle large amounts of data and high traffic better.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Transactions and Consistency:\n",
    "\n",
    "* SQL Databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Ensure reliable and consistent transactions with ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability).\n",
    "2. Data is always kept consistent.\n",
    "\n",
    "* NoSQL Databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Focus on availability and partition tolerance, often with BASE properties (Basically Available, Soft state, Eventual consistency).\n",
    "2. Data may not be immediately consistent across all nodes, but will eventually be consistent.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Use Cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "* SQL Databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Best for structured data with clear relationships, like in financial systems or customer management.\n",
    "2. Good for complex queries and detailed reports.\n",
    "\n",
    "* NoSQL Databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Ideal for unstructured or semi-structured data, such as JSON or XML.\n",
    "2. Used in big data, real-time web applications, and content management systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. Query Language:\n",
    "\n",
    "* SQL Databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use SQL (Structured Query Language) for managing and querying data.\n",
    "\n",
    "* NoSQL Databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use different query languages or APIs depending on the database type, like MongoDB's JSON-based queries or Cassandra's CQL (Cassandra Query Language).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Summary:\n",
    "SQL Databases: Structured, fixed schema, strong consistency, suitable for complex queries.\n",
    "NoSQL Databases: Flexible schema, scalable, eventual consistency, ideal for big data and real-time applications."

    "\n",
    "DROP TABLE employees;\n",

    "\n",
    "* Purpose: To modify the structure of existing database objects. This can include adding, deleting, or modifying columns in a table.\n",

    "## Primary Key\n",
    "A Primary Key is a column or a set of columns in a database table that uniquely identifies each row in that table. Primary keys must contain unique values and cannot contain NULL values. They are used to ensure that each record in the table is distinct and to provide a way to reference individual records.\n",
    "\n",

    "1. Uniqueness: Each value in the primary key column(s) must be unique.\n",
    "2. Non-nullable: Primary key columns cannot contain NULL values.\n",
    "3. Single column or composite: A primary key can consist of a single column or multiple columns (composite primary key).\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "Consider a table employees:\n",
    "\n",
    "CREATE TABLE employees (\n",
    "    employee_id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "    first_name VARCHAR(50),\n",

    "\n",
    "In this example, employee_id is the primary key for the employees table, ensuring that each employee has a unique identifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Foreign Key\n",
    "A Foreign Key is a column or a set of columns in a database table that establishes a link between the data in two tables. The foreign key in the child table references the primary key in the parent table. This relationship enforces referential integrity, ensuring that the value in the foreign key column corresponds to an existing value in the primary key column of the related table.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Characteristics:\n",
    "* Referential Integrity: Ensures that values in the foreign key column(s) match values in the primary key column(s) of the referenced table.\n",
    "* Link Between Tables: Establishes a relationship between tables, enabling data to be organized and retrieved more efficiently.\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "Consider two tables, employees and departments:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Departments Table:\n",
    "\n",
    "CREATE TABLE departments (\n",
    "    department_id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",

    "    department_id INT,\n",
    "    FOREIGN KEY (department_id) REFERENCES departments(department_id)\n",

    "In this example:\n",

    "7. DISTINCT: Removes duplicate rows from the result set.\n",
    "8. ORDER BY: Sorts the result set based on one or more columns.\n",
