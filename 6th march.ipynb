Inferential statistics are used to derive conclusions and inferences from samples, i.e. to create accurate generalisations.\n",

Weight, height and distance are all examples of ratio variables. Data in the ratio scale can be added, subtracted, divided and multiplied.\n",

In statistics, the mean, median, and mode are the three most common measures of central tendency. Each one calculates the central point using a different method.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Median : The median is the middle value. It is the value that splits the dataset in half, making it a natural measure of central tendency.\n",
    "To find the median, order your data from smallest to largest, and then find the data point that has an equal number of values above it and below it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mode : The mode is the value that occurs the most frequently in your data set, making it a different type of measure of central tendency than the mean or median.To find the mode, sort the values in your dataset by numeric values or by categories. Then identify the value that occurs most often.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the common Measures of Variability used in Statistics are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Range: The range is the difference between the largest and smallest values in a dataset. The range provides a simple measure of variability, but it can be sensitive to extreme values or outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variance: The variance measures the average squared deviation from the mean in a dataset. The variance is useful when you want to quantify the spread of a dataset, and it is used in many statistical tests and models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Standard deviation: The standard deviation is the square root of the variance. The standard deviation provides a more intuitive measure of variability, since it is in the same units as the original data."
